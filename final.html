        <h1>WE ARE KAT VON D BEAUTY!</h1>
        <p>

If you had asked me when I was a child, running around barefoot in Mexico with dirt under my fingernails and frogs in my pockets, if I could have foreseen this wild makeup adventure becoming a reality, I probably would have laughed in your face in disbelief!
<br>
People often tell me, "Having your own makeup line must be a dream come true!" But the truth is, never in a million years did I ever imagine I’d be here celebrating all these wonderful years of beauty with you all!
<br>
When Sephora approached me about creating a makeup line back in 2008, my goal was to come up with the four most perfect shades of red lipstick. Fast-forward to today…Kat Von D Beauty has grown into such a big and beautiful monster that it’s easy to lose count of the shade range now! And to me, that makes every day BETTER than a dream. To me, every day is a gift, and I am beyond excited to share this gift with all of you.
<br>
Together with my team, we have created something so special and unique in the makeup world.
Kat Von D Beauty is a creative outlet for everyone, from beginners to pros (and even to makeup-junkies like myself).
<br>
It is my belief that Art is one of humanity’s most powerfully redeeming qualities. If I can continue to come up with these tools that inspire people to create, I am more than happy to do so!
<br>
There is no aspect of the makeup line that I have not been creatively involved with, and this is something that I am proud of. I take part in everything from product development, personally testing formulas, naming the shades, packaging design and artwork layout, to the lettering you’ll find on every fixture at Sephora! When I commit to being a part of something, my ultimate goal is to have an intention behind everything.
<br>
Quality over Quantity.<br>
Less is More.<br>

When in doubt, throw that shit out!<br>

But in all reality, if you want to know who Kat Von D Beauty is, all you gotta do is look in the mirror.<br>

We are bold, unapologetic, outspoken and different in our own way. We are artists, poets and lovers. We are the outsiders and the insiders.<br>

We are Kat Von D Beauty.<br>

With Love,<br>
KvD<br>
